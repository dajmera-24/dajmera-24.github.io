abstract: A superpermutation is a sequence that contains every permutation of n distinct symbols as a contiguous substring. For example, a valid example for three symbols is a sequence that contains all six permutations. This paper introduces a new algorithm that constructs such sequences more efficiently than existing recursive and graph-theoretic methods. Unlike traditional techniques that suffer from scalability and factorial memory demands, the proposed approach builds superpermutations directly and compactly. This reduces space complexity to linear in the number of symbols, enabling the construction of larger sequences previously considered impractical under the factorial growth typical of other approaches.
